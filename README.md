# Drug-Efficacy-Prediction

The Drug Efficaccy ppt has more details about the datasets, Model architecture(slide 13)

1) The drug features are extracted using SMILES and PaDel Library in python
2) GDSC dataset is the base dataset with Drug, Cell Line and Response(LN IC50)
3) RNA and Copy Number Variations are used as Cell Line features
4) The dimensionality of the RNA and Copy Numbers datasets is reduced using Autoencoders
